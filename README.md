# Student Assistant

Student Assistant is a project which delivers a user-friendly application which can be run on both android and google chrome to help students in Information Engineering in HAW Hamburg to calculate their GPAs in 3 different systems: US System, DE System and HAW System. 

By creating such application, international students who are already enrolled in the program won't have to worry about conversion formulas when it comes to using their graduation certificates in other countries.
